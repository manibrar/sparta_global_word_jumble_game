Word-Jumble-Demo
Code from first sprint for a game using javascript.

Purpose
This is a sample HTML5 / JS / CSS game developed with javascript.

Markup has been styled to be responsive, according to the device used to view the app.

It is intended as a demonstration of technical capabilities rather than design or helpful data. :-)

Note also that it is a work in progress; you can check out what features are in the pipeline in the issues list.

Words are stored in an array which are then split into letters and presented on the page in a raondomized format.

CSS
responsive web development/design (no separate m-dot site)
